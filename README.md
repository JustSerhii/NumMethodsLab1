Find the smallest root of the nonlinear equation (x−1)^3 + 0.5e^x = 0 by the dichotomy method, 
modified Newton's method and the simple iteration method 
with an accuracy of ε = 10^−4 . Find the a priori and a posteriori estimate 
of the number of steps. Choose the same initial interval and initial 
approximation for both methods (if possible), compare the results of the methods.
